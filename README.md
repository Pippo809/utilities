# Utilities
Useful utilities I developed during my work/studies/projects

For now I developed the following utilities:
- [**`convert_html_markdown`**](tools/convert_html_markdown.py): Convert a folder of HTML files to Markdown
- [**`convert_pdf_to_excel`**](tools/convert_pdf_to_excel.py): Convert a PDF file to Excel
